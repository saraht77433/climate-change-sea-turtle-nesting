# Analyzing Climate Change Effects on Sea Turtle Nesting Patterns

## Overview
This project investigates how climate change influences sea turtle nesting behaviors by merging nesting data from the SWOT dataset with temperature data from NOAA. The analysis uses Python to explore potential correlations between temperature changes and nesting patterns.

## Data Sources
- State of the World's Sea Turtles (SWOT) dataset  
- NOAA temperature data  

## Tools & Technologies
- SQLite for data merging and queries  
- Python with Matplotlib for visualization  

## Methods
Datasets were cleaned and formatted, then loaded for analysis. Visualizations were generated to identify trends and correlations.

## Ethical Considerations
- Used trusted data sources to ensure accuracy.  
- Considered privacy concerns regarding sensitive nesting locations.  
- Acknowledged risks in merging datasets only by year and possible data inconsistencies.

## Deliverables
- Project report including analysis and ethical considerations  

## Purpose
To analyze the impact of climate change on sea turtle nesting patterns to support conservation efforts.
